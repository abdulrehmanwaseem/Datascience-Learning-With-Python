**DataScience Learning With Python**
A hands-on repository for learning core data science concepts using Pythonâ€™s ecosystem. This project includes:

* **Python** scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating end-to-end workflows.
* **NumPy** examples for efficient numerical computing and array operations.
* **Pandas** tutorials covering data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
* **Seaborn** visualizations showcasing statistical plotting techniques and exploratory data analysis.

Work through organized notebooks that guide you from basic data manipulation to creating insightful visualizations. Each folder contains annotated code, sample datasets (CSV/JSON), and clear instructions to help you practice:

1. Loading and inspecting real-world datasets.
2. Wrangling and reshaping data with pandas.
3. Performing vectorized computations with NumPy.
4. Building publication-quality plots using Seaborn.

Use this repo as a learning path or a reference library to strengthen your Python-based data science skills.
